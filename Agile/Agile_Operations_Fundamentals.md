# Agile Operations Fundamentals
---
### What is operations work ?
<span style="color:lightblue" ><b><i>"Operations work refers to repeatable processes that are continuous in nature with no defined start and end date"</b></i></span>

- Known as the day to day work activities
	- Recruitment, Finance, Call centers, supply chain, software operations, HR, marketing

### Operations work
- Any repeatable process that deliver value
- Usually has no defined start and end date
- Business as usual

### Program work
- Any type of project with a defined start and end date

---
## What is the operations pattern ?
<span style="color:lightblue" ><b><i>"The operations pattern is the approach used to get operations work done"</b></i></span>

### Steps taken

##### Request
- It starts with some sort of incomming request for work, like a help desk ticket or a call

##### Prioritization
- The work is prioritzed against all the other work to determine the completion order of all requests

##### Operations Funnel
- Work moves through a funnel with highest priority being addressed first and then second, etc
- A backlog is formed with highest priority being first

##### Delivery
- Team delivers the work they have pulled from the funnel

### Bottlenecks
- You can only deliver as fast as the slowest part of your process
- Even after resolving a bottlenexk it likely thereis aanother somewhere else in the process
- As a team , decide where the bottlenecks should go
- Clear out what bottlenecks that can be removed so the ones that cannot change remain

### Continuous Improvement
- Even if the operations are repeatable and the same, it will benefit from improvement for better results
- Does not matter which technique is used to achieve these results

## Adding Agile into the operations pattern
<span style="color:lightblue" ><b><i>"Teams are empowered when  Agile methods are incorporated into operations work"</b></i></span>

### Agile - Social Contracts in operations
<span style="color:lightblue" ><b><i>"A social contract is an agreement that defines how a team will work together"</b></i></span>

- Creating a wall of sticky notes to brainstorm ideas
- Easier for everyone to voice their opinions and no one is left out
- Questions based on
	- What do we value ?
	- What is important 
	- What can we count on from one another ?
	- What are the consequences if the social contract is violated
- In operations, the contract is created by who owns the process or part of it
- The social contract is reviewed and changed periodically for adjustments

### Agile - Iterations in operations
<span style="color:lightblue" ><b><i>"Iterations are scheduled blocks of time, that are repeated to get the work done"</b></i></span>

- The team chooses the work to be completed from the funnel in each iteration
- An iteration is 3-4 weeks long compared to program work which is typically 2 weeks
- The work is continuous in operations with no start and end date to complete work
- Iterations in operations act like more of a review or status update
- Adjust iteration period based on team needs

### Agile practice - Wall of Work in operations
<span style="color:lightblue" ><b><i>"A wall of work is a simple visual depiction of how teams can track their progress on work completion"</b></i></span>

- Same concept applies 
- There's a todo - doing - done , table for the continious process (can be different)
- For example with tickets, they can be put in a todo column, and progress through the columns of the table
- Agile team uses the Kanban method for managing wall of work

### Agile Stand-Ups
<span style="color:lightblue" ><b><i>"Stand-ups are short status meetings"</b></i></span>

- ![[Agile_basics#Stand-up]]
- Stand-up times are more flexible since work is continious in operations
- Stand-ups typically occur about once a month but the same three questions are asked

### Agile Retrospectives - Operations
<span style="color:lightblue" ><b><i>"A retrospective meeting is an opportunity for teams to reflect on their perforamncec and look for ways to improve"</b></i></span>

- Very important for teams to undertake as it allows them to understand how they can imporve for better resutls
- Occurence of retrospective depnds on team and task
- Anwers the fundamental question of Agile : "How do we get better ?"

## Agile Operations Teams

### Self Directed Teams
<span style="color:lightblue" ><b><i>"Self-directed teams are small in size, have the right skills and embrace collaboration and innovation to improve the quality and quantity of work"</b></i></span>

- Agile teams are cross-functional
- Members have various skillsets and from different departments
- This ensures appropriate perspectives for decisions on what work to complete and how
- Agile team consists of 
	- Core Team - Bulk of the workload
	- Extended Team - Assist when needed
	- Governance Team - Provides overall guidance
- For smaller amounts of work, such a composition is not required

### Core Team
<span style="color:lightblue" ><b><i>"The core team is small, dedicated, cross-functional, and empowered"</b></i></span>

- Small : Teams of 5-9 people
- Dedicated : People on the team are dedicated to that team
- Cross Fucntional : All skills present to do the work
- Empowered : Ability for the team itself to make decisions
