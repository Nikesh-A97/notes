# Big Data 101
---
## What is Big Data ?
- Any digital trace (or data) that is used and analyzed for various reasons
- Data that is too large to store and analyze in one go
- 4Vs that demand cost effective and effiecent processing techniques

### 4(5)Vs of Big Data

#### Velocity
- Speed of the data
- Data is being generated quickly
- Real-time batch or stream processing

#### Volume
- Data generated is vast compared to traditional data sources
- > Exabytes of data
- Increase in # of data and scalable infrastructure

#### Veracity
- Quality of the data
- Accuracy and reliability of the data
- Cost of the need to trace and justify data
- Structured data

#### Variety
- Different types of data
- Vidoes, text, images, etc

#### Value
- Turn data into some value
- Profit, insights, personal benefit

## The impact of Big data
### Uses of big data
- Recomendation engines used to show products based on your preferences
- Personal voice recognition systems that answer questions
- AI and ML use it
- Route guidance systems
- IoTs and wearbles

## Big data & Data science

### Key aspects

#### Integration
- Bring together all data from different sources
- One-stop shop (DW)
- Use Hadoop HDFS to create a cetralised place to store data

#### Analysis
- Analyze data such as tracking customer habits
- Use this to make better user experinces 

#### Visulization
- Good for non-technical consumers of data
- Easy to digest and understand for BAs to make decsions for BI

#### Workload Optimization
- Optimize workloads for faster proccesing of big data

#### Security
- Data privacy is critical 
- How data is collected, retained, used and disclosed

#### Governance
- Automated integration (easy to access data from sources)
- Visual context (indexing for easy usage)
- Agile governance (value of the data and intended use)

### Data science
- Process of distilling insights from data to inform decsions
- DS Process
	- Determine Problem
	- Collect Data
	- Explore Data
	- Analyze Data
	- Storytelling & Visulization
	- Take actions

## Big data use cases

### Data exploratin
- Integrate data sources for a unified view
- Gain new insights and enchanced value
- ML algorithms can be trained from historical data

### Improving security
- Processing and analyzing data to improve security

### Operations analysis
- Analyzing machine data (logs, gps)
- Large volume and variety of formats
- Using big data tech for complex analysis

### Hadoop
- Open source framework to store and process large amounts of data
- Implemented in specialized modules
	- Storage (implements HDFS)
	- Resource management
	- Distributed proccessing based on Map Reduce
	- Common Utilities and librabries for Hadpoop platform
- A node is just a computing unit
- A rack is collection of nodes, physically stored close together
- A cluster is a collection of node

### Hadoop Strategy
- Choosing recommended distributions
- Maturing the environment with modern architecture
- Adopting a data lake strategy based on Hadoop tech
- "big data is  best thought of as a data platform"
