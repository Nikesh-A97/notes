## MDX & Multi-Dimensional Data 

### What is MDX & Multi-dimensional Data ?
Multi-dimensional data is storing data in the form "cubes". Multi-dimensional expressions (MDX) is a query language used to interact with this data in various ways such as
- Create and build the architecture for dimensions and cubes
- Query multi-dimensional data
- Perform calculations on multi-dimensional data
- Define security restrictions
- Use BI/Analytical tools to report/display data


### Multi-Dimensional Data VS Relational Data
Relational data is stored as a table,  with rows for dimensions and measures or keys for columns. However with multi-dimensional data, it is stored in 3 or more dimensions.

#### Relational Data (2D)
- Is in a tabular format that consist of rows and columns
- An intersection between row(s) and column(s)
- SQL query returns a table with rows and columns

#### Multi-Dimensinal Data
- Can bee seen as an intersection between multiple dimensions
- MDX queries return a "cellset" which is "flattened" into 2D for display
